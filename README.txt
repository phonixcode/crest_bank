# Question
Develop a 3-stage single page jquery driven registration page for
registration of new depositors for a bank system. Observe the following:

- The registration form must contain at least 15 fields including phone
number and email
- Registration process must be divided into 3 stages with the first
stage as email verification.
- Use only a single page with each stage being displayed one after the
other using jquery
- Validate all fields. Ensure that compulsory fields are filled.
- Display adequate notification and use indications to show registration
progress level.
- Create an admin view to display registered depositors. Admin view must
have a login page.
- Use PHP, CSS, HTML, MySQL and JQUERY. You are allowed to use MVC
frameworks and design templates.
- Check out for vulnerabilities.

# Important information

-	Enable you local server, preferrably, Apache. You can install xampp to make this easy for you.

-	Ensure you unzip the zipped folder in you localhost directory i.e "C:\xampp\htdocs\". You should have crest-bank folder. Check the yellow colour of the image in the folder for proper understanding of the directory.

-	Open a browser, google chrome should be fine.

-	Ensure you are connected to the internet.

-	After that, copy this: "localhost/crest-bank/create_schema.php" without the pair of double quotes and paste in the browser's address bar then press enter.

-	...and you are done. The required database and tables will be created.

-	You can use "localhost/crest-bank/index.php" without the pair of double quotes to start working with the project.

-	Here is the link to the admin login page: http://localhost/solution/solution/validate.php.
